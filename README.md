### `Details About This Project`
Braido is a Online Watch Shop Website Where I use React Router for 

Single Page Application & used "Heroku" For clint side dynamic api & used 

"MongoDB" for get, push or delete information about packages.

There are some Private Route & Nested Route for Admin & User. Which is Require user & Admin Login. 

For Login Process I used Firebase Authentication. 

Here is Different path for User And Admin Dashboard.

Hence I also try to do this site responsive by using Material Ui.
